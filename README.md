# CHERIE AN AI VIRTUAL ASSISTANT
In this project, we are going to create a Python based AI Virtual Assistant so called 'Cherie' which can do various useful tasks by taking voice commands as an input and perform different kinds of operations accordingly.This code will help you to get through the basics of building your own digital virtual assistant in Python.

## IMPORTANT MOUDULES AND LIBRARIES :
### SpeechRecognition: 
It’s one of the most straightforward Python libraries for recognizing and processing human speech. It would be responsible for recognizing the speech/verbal commands of the assistant’s user and identifying the input words/input phrases, i.e., the words that will trigger a response from the assistant.

### pyttsx3: 
This library offers the reverse of SpeechRecognition. This text-to-speech library will convert the text commands you add to the code (the assistant would say to the user). It’s cross-platform (making it ideal for more than just a test virtual assistant) and also works offline.

### Webbrowser: 
One of the most common commands a virtual assistant receives is opening a website like Google, YouTube, or Amazon. The Webbrowser module in Python takes care of that. Once called, it can open a website on your default browser.

### Wikipedia: 
Wikipedia module fetches information directly from one of the most extensive knowledge repositories online.

### PyWhatKit:
It is a Python library with various helpful features. It's easy-to-use and does not require you to do any additional setup. Currently, it has about 300k+ downloads and counting. New updates are released frequently with new features and bug fixes.

### pyjokes:
One line jokes for programmers (jokes as a service)

### Requests:
Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

#### To add these, you will have to execute the following commands in the terminal:

pip install pyttsx3
 
pip install SpeechRecognition
                                
pip install Wikipedia
                                                              
pip install webbrowser

pip install pywhatkit

pip install pyjokes

pip install requests



When running this code on PyCharm, you might encounter an error regarding PyAudio and will have to download that library.
And if the usual “pip install PyAudio” command doesn’t work, you will have to go with a workaround. First, install Pipwin and then use the command “Pipwin install PyAudio.”

## Necessary imports:

import speech_recognition as sr

import pyttsx3

import pywhatkit

import datetime

import wikipedia

import pyjokes

import sys

import webbrowser

import random

import requests

import randfacts

from datetime import date, datetime
